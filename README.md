# Hello PHP 
This is a tutorial begineer journey of me learning about PHP 
PHP is a server-side language that has become a massive success for three reasons:
1. It is a very easy and forgiving language. Variables can be anything, and you can create them anytime you want.
2. It is part of the free LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) and thus available on almost any server you can rent on the Web.
3. It does not need a special editor, environment or build process. All you do is create a file of the .php file type, mix PHP and HTML and then put it on your server for rendering.
